/*
 * Reading interrupt-driven GPIO pins on the Realtek RTL8720C.
 *
 * As soon as an interrupt is attached to a pin, LibreTiny removes the pin's
 * plain GPIO mode, because the RTL8720C can't use both at once. If
 * digitalRead() is called on such a pin later, LibreTiny sets the pin up as a
 * GPIO input again and frees the interrupt on the way. ESPHome's
 * remote_receiver reads its pin from inside the interrupt handler, so the
 * receiver lost its interrupt on the very first edge and never saw a code.
 *
 * The firmware is linked with -Wl,--wrap=digitalRead (see the `esphome:`
 * block in broadlink-rm4-mini.yaml), which routes every digitalRead() call
 * through the function below. Pins with an active interrupt are read through
 * their interrupt object, every other pin goes to LibreTiny's digitalRead()
 * unchanged. LibreTiny itself is not modified.
 *
 * The fix follows the LibreTiny patch from phdindota, who tracked this down
 * first. Thank you!
